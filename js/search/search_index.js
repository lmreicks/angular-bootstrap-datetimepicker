(please let me know if it does not work for your use case!), \nor see https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/\nfor the automatically generated documentation.\nFirst day of week\nThe first day of the week is determined by  moment's i18n settings.\nFor example, setting the locale to 'fr' will cause Monday to be the first day of the week.  \nDisplay of year, month, day, hour, am/pm, and minute formats\nThe format of hours and minutes is also determined by moment's i18n settings.\nhours are displayed using ll as the format.\nminutes are displayed using lll as the format. \nI recommend you use the default locale settings from Moment (if they are incorrect, submit a PR to moment to correct the settings)\nIf for some reason the default Moment settings will not work, you can customize the existing locale or create a custom locale with the desired formats.\nDocumentation\nYou can generate the documentation by running npm run documentation\nor see https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/\nAccessibility\nThe DlDateTimePickerComponent component adds aria-label attributes to the left, right, and up buttons\nin addition to all calendar cells where the text of the cell may not fully describe the value.\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe DlDateTimePickerComponent component supports the following keyboard shortcuts in all views:\n\n\n\nShortcut\nAction\n\n\n\n\nLEFT_ARROW\nGo to the cell to the left\n\n\nRIGHT_ARROW\nGo to the cell to the right\n\n\nUP_ARROW\nGo to the cell above\n\n\nDOWN_ARROW\nGo to the cell below\n\n\nHOME\nGo to the first cell in the view\n\n\nEND\nGo to the last cell in the view\n\n\nPAGE_UP\nGo to the same cell in the previous time period\n\n\nPAGE_DOWN\nGo to the same cell in the next time period\n\n\nENTER or SPACE\nSelect current cell\n\n\n\nScreen shots\nYear view\n\nThis view allows the user to select the year for the target date.\nIf the year view is the minView, the date will be set to midnight on the first day of the year\nMonth view\n\nThis view allows the user to select the month in the selected year.\nIf the month view is the minView, the date will be set to midnight on the first day of the month.\nDay view (Default)\n\nThis view allows the user to select the the day of the month, in the selected month.\nIf the day view is the minView, the date will be set to midnight on the day selected.\nHour view\n\nThis view allows the user to select the hour of the day, on the selected day.\nIf the hour view is the minView, the date will be set to the beginning of the hour on the day selected.\nMinute view\n\nThis view allows the user to select a specific time of day, in the selected hour.\nBy default, the time is displayed in 5 minute increments. The minuteStep property controls the increments of time displayed.\nIf the minute view is the minView, which is is by default, the date will be set to the beginning of the hour on the day selected.\noptional:\nContributing\nSee Contributing.md\nTesting\nThis component was written using TDD and all enhancements and changes have related tests.\nWe use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use gulp:\nnpm install\nnpm testThe karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests.\nMake sure Chrome is available or change the browsers setting in karma.config.js\nLicense\nangular-bootstrap-datetimepicker is released under the MIT license and is copyright 2015 Knight Rider Consulting, Inc..
